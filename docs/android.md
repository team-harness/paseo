# Android

## App variants

Controlled by `APP_VARIANT` in `packages/app/app.config.js` (vanilla Expo, no custom Gradle plugin):

| Variant       | App name    | Package ID       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| `production`  | Paseo       | `sh.paseo`       |
| `development` | Paseo Debug | `sh.paseo.debug` |

EAS profiles: `development`, `production`, and `production-apk` in `packages/app/eas.json`.

`development` uses Android `debug`.

## Version codes

`packages/app/app.config.js` derives Android `versionCode` from the package version with:

```text
major * 1_000_000 + minor * 1_000 + patch
```

Prerelease metadata is ignored, so `0.1.102-beta.1` and `0.1.102` both produce `1102`. The same value is used as the iOS `buildNumber` because `packages/app/eas.json` uses EAS's local app version source. Do not re-enable EAS remote version counters or Android `autoIncrement`; F-Droid and other source-based builders need the native build number to be visible in the repo.

The formula reserves three digits each for minor and patch. If either reaches `1000`, change the formula before cutting that release.

## Local build + install

From repo root:

```bash
npm run android:development    # Debug build
npm run android:production     # Release build
npm run android:clear          # Remove generated Android project
```

Or from `packages/app`:

```bash
# Debug
npx cross-env APP_VARIANT=development expo prebuild --platform android --non-interactive
npx cross-env APP_VARIANT=development expo run:android --variant=debug

# Release
npx cross-env APP_VARIANT=production expo prebuild --platform android --non-interactive
npx cross-env APP_VARIANT=production expo run:android --variant=release

# Clear generated Android project
rm -rf android
```

## F-Droid / source-only Android builds

F-Droid builds should set `PASEO_FDROID_BUILD=1` when running Expo prebuild:

```bash
cd packages/app
PASEO_FDROID_BUILD=1 APP_VARIANT=production npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean --non-interactive
cd android
PASEO_FDROID_BUILD=1 ./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon --max-workers=1 -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false
```

The flag must be present for both prebuild and Gradle because Gradle starts Metro for the release bundle. Keep the source build serial and daemon-free as shown above: compiling every Expo module can exhaust memory when Gradle workers run in parallel. The profile enables source-built Expo modules, excludes the proprietary camera, Firebase notification, and Expo development-client native modules, disables EAS updates and Gradle dependency metadata, and substitutes JavaScript stubs for camera and notifications. The resulting app supports direct and pasted-link pairing but not QR scanning or push notifications.

Keep the excluded npm packages installed. Normal builds use them, while the F-Droid profile removes only their Android native modules and config plugins. Paseo always applies `expo-gradle-jvmargs` with `-Xmx4096m` and `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m` so local Expo prebuilds have enough Gradle heap whether they use precompiled AARs or source-built Expo modules.

### React version lockstep

Keep `react` and `react-dom` pinned to the React version embedded by the current `react-native` release. React Native `0.81.x` embeds `react-native-renderer` `19.1.0`, so `packages/app` must use React `19.1.0`. Bumping React to a newer patch can build successfully but crash at JS startup on Android with `Incompatible React versions`, leaving the app on the native splash screen.

```

## Cloud build + submit (EAS)

Stable tag pushes like `v0.1.0` trigger:

- The EAS GitHub app on Expo servers (iOS + Android production builds + store submit). There is no workflow file in this repo for it.
- `.github/workflows/android-apk-release.yml` on GitHub Actions (APK asset on GitHub Release).

iOS auto-submits to App Store review via a Fastlane lane after EAS uploads to TestFlight. Android auto-submits to the Play Store via EAS-managed credentials.

Beta tags like `v0.1.1-beta.1` only trigger the GitHub APK workflow. They publish a GitHub prerelease APK for testing and do not submit to the stores.

`android-v*` tags also trigger only the GitHub APK workflow — useful when you want to ship an APK without going through stores. The GitHub APK workflow supports `workflow_dispatch` with an existing `tag` input so you can rebuild without cutting a new tag.

### Useful commands

```bash
cd packages/app

# Recent builds
npx eas build:list --limit 10 --non-interactive --json | jq '.[] | {platform, status, appVersion, gitCommitHash}'

# Inspect a build (the printed `Logs` URL opens the build's Expo dashboard page,
# which has a Submissions section showing the auto-submit to the Play Store).
npx eas build:view <build-id>
```

The Play Console (Internal testing → Production tracks) is the final confirmation that the binary reached the store.
